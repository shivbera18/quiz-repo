# AI Question Generation Fix - COMPLETED âœ…

## Issue Fixed
The AI-generated questions were failing to save to the question bank due to database model name mismatch and schema field incompatibilities.

## Root Cause
1. **Database Model Mismatch**: API routes were using `prisma.questionBank` but the schema defined `QuestionBankItem`
2. **Schema Field Mismatch**: API was trying to save fields that don't exist in the PostgreSQL schema (`image`, `source`, `createdBy`, `isVerified`)
3. **Missing Error Handling**: Limited debugging information for troubleshooting

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Model Corrections
- Updated `app/api/admin/question-bank/route.ts` to use `QuestionBankItem` model
- Updated `app/api/admin/question-bank/[id]/route.ts` to use `QuestionBankItem` model
- Fixed all CRUD operations (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)

### 2. Schema Field Alignment
- Removed non-existent fields from API operations:
  - `image` field
  - `source` field  
  - `createdBy` field
  - `isVerified` field
- Aligned with PostgreSQL schema that only includes: `id`, `section`, `question`, `options`, `correctAnswer`, `explanation`, `difficulty`, `tags`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

### 3. Enhanced Debugging
- Added comprehensive logging to `handleAIGenerate` function in question bank page
- Added detailed logging to AI generator component
- Created test scripts to verify API functionality

## Verification Results âœ…

### API Testing
```bash
# All tests passed:
âœ… AI generation successful (2 questions generated)
âœ… Question 1 saved with ID: 20e7910c-63e8-4e1d-8ab7-9262978116e7
âœ… Question 2 saved with ID: 36a95614-f504-4288-9d8b-fddc635008f3
âœ… Questions fetched successfully (4 total in database)
```

### Database Testing
```bash
# Direct database save test passed:
âœ… Question created successfully: 4a9edce2-8989-49f5-862e-986d0c1ce8e6
âœ… Question retrieved successfully with correct data structure
âœ… Test question cleaned up properly
```
